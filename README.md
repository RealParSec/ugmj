# UGMJ - Repository

## What is UGMJ?
UGMJ stands for `Unfinished GmodStore Jobs`. This is repository where I upload all of the scripts I write for GMS jobs and get unpaid.

## Why did I created this repository?
Because if I realese script I wrote for some f*** who decides to scum me... What can be more humiliating than watching how other servers use the scripts he/she originally ordered and wanted it to be only on his/her server? Answer: Redistributing that script for free.

## Why not sell it?
Well I have taken a lot from GMod community for free, so it's time I give something for free too.

## What does every folder contain?
- Addon itself
- Readme file with info:
  - Who ordered the script
  - State (unfinished/finished)
  - Info on what is done and what you have to code yourself (of course if asked nicely I can finish the script)
