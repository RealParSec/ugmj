Before we give you any further support we would like you to perform these steps:

1. Shutdown your server
2. Navigate to `garrysmod/addons/` and create there folder called `disabled`
   - Move all your "folder addons" in to the newly created folder, except our addons
3. In your startup command remove `+host_workshop_collection <WS Collection ID>`
4. Start your server

If the instruction above didn't work report back to us with error spilled out in the console.
However, if the instruction worked and the error disappeared, we would like to ask you to perform these additional steps:

1. Shutdown your server
2. Navigate to `garrysmod/addons/` and move 1 addon out of folder `disabled`
3. Start the server
4. Here are two options:
   - If no error appears go back to step 1 of this instruction and repeat steps
   - If error appeared please perform these additional steps:
     - Note down name of the addon you moved from folder `disabled`
     - Move it back to `disabled` folder
     - Go back to step 1
5. Perform this step until you go thru all of you addons

**Warning if you use any leaks your support will be immediately denied!!!**
